This repository contains an HowTo, scripts, and config files to build an olsrd routing daemon package for mips/mips64, which is the architecture used by some routers such as the ubiquiti edgerouter.

The motivation for this is that the packages provided officially by debian are **very** outdated.

We will set-up a qemu mips64 vritual machine and then use it to build an olsrd .deb package.


Build a debian qemu-mipsel virtual machine
------------------------------------------

Create a directory for qemu files
    
    mkdir mipsel
    cd mipsel 


Install qemu on your system, then create a disk::

    qemu-img create -f qcow2 disk.img 4G

Download the debian mips kernel and the initrd that contains the debian installer (the debian version used by the edgerouter is wheezy)::

    wget http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/wheezy/main/installer-mipsel/current/images/malta/netboot/vmlinux-3.2.0-4-4kc-malta
    wget http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/wheezy/main/installer-mipsel/current/images/malta/netboot/initrd.gz

Launch the virtual machine::

    qemu-system-mipsel \
        -M malta \
        -hda mipsel/disk.img \
        -kernel mipsel/vmlinux-3.2.0-4-4kc-malta \
        -initrd mipsel/initrd.gz \
        -append "console=ttyS0" \
        -nographic 

And install debian using the installer.


After finishing the installation, we need to copy the kernel and the initrd from the ``/boot/`` directory to outside the virtual machine.

mv olsrd-0.9.0.3.tar.gz olsrd_0.9.0.3.orig.tar.gz

To transfer them out you can use an ``scp`` through the network to another machine, for example.

Note that the kernel and initrd files are different from the installation ones used above.

Lauch the debian qemu-mipsel virtual machine:

    qemu-system-mipsel \
        -M malta \
        -hda mipsel/disk.img \
        -append "root=/dev/sda1 console=ttyS0" \
        -m 1024 \
        -nographic 


Later, to exit the qemu VM you can use ctrl-a,x.

Build the debian package from inside the debian qemu-mipsel virtual machine
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

After launching the debian qemu-mipsel virtual machine as described above, install some build dependencies::

   apt-get install build-essential devscripts devhelper flex bison
  
Download the olsrd tarball for which you want to build the debian package::

   wget http://www.olsr.org/releases/0.9/olsrd-0.9.0.3.tar.gz
  
Rename the olsrd tarball according to the debian's way::

   mv olsrd-0.9.0.3.tar.gz olsrd_0.9.0.3.orig.tar.gz
  
and extract it::

   tar xf olsrd_0.9.0.3.orig.tar.gz
  
Get the ``debian/`` directory with some ninux-targeted customizations (contained in this repository and described below)::

   wget https://github.com/ninuxorg/ninux-olsrd-debian/archive/master.tar.gz -O ninux-olsrd-debian.tar.gz

and extract it::

   tar xf ninux-olsrd-debian.tar.gz
  
Move the ``debian/`` directory to the directory with the olsrd sources and cd to it::

   mv -v ninux-olsrd-debian-master/debian olsrd-0.9.0.3/
   cd olsrd-0.9.0.3/debian
  
Update the debian ``changelog`` with the ``dch`` tool (e.g. the ``-v`` option updates the version in the changelog)::

   export EDITOR=vim
   dch -v
  
Edit the ``control`` file, if needed::

   vim control
  
Build the debian packages (from inside the debian directory)::

   debuild -us -uc 


Ninux targeted customizations
-----------------------------
The customizations are essentially a mix of the official olsrd debian package and the FunkFeuer olsrd debian package (http://build.ffgraz.net/deb/dists/wheezy/main/source/net/ which is currently not available for mips).

For more details please see the ``git log`` of the ``debian/`` directory of this repository.
